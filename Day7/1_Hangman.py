#The EDP Era began in the early 1960s and is characterized by the purchase of the first centralized mainframe or a mini-computer by large organizations. The IT projects during this era focused generally on automating various organizational transactions such as general accounting tasks, inventory management, and production scheduling. The manager of this technology resource was often called the Data Processing (DP) manager and usually reported to the head accounting or financial manager. The goal of using technology was to improve efficiency and reduce costs by automating many of the manual or clerical tasks performed by people. As Richard Nolan (2001) points out, software programmers applied computer technology similar to the ways that farmers or engineers applied steam engine technology to mechanize agriculture. The process remained relatively unchanged, while the means for doing the process became more efficient. Subsequently, IT projects during this era were generally structured, and therefore a structured approach for managing these projects could be used. Since the requirements or business processes were fairly stable, changing requirements were not a major issue and large, multi-year projects were common. Unfortunately in many cases these legacy systems created information silos as projects supported specific business functions that often employed different technology platforms and programming languages.
